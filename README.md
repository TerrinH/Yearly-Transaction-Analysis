# Yearly-Transaction-Analysis
A simple Excel spreadsheet template created to help me track my financial trends. Makes use of a few macros.

I take the .CSV files I download from my various banking accounts and put that information into the corrisponding worksheet's pivot table. Then, on the "Categories" worksheet I put the category header in the first column, such as "FUEL", and each cell within the same row is the text strings that match "FUEL" such as "BP" or "PHILLIPS", ect.. The trasnsaction description column within the pivot tables is what is searched to attempt to categorize.
